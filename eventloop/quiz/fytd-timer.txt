- In eventloop/timer.js, what will be the order of execution? Briefly explain the order of execution w.r.t the event loop phases.

The console log and baz functions will be executed twice first because the foo function is called
twice in the main thread, after the main thread is complete there are 2 bar functions waiting to be
executed in the event loop.
